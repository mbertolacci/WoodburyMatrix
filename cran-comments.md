## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added the "cph" tag to the author to identify the copyright holder.
* Added a reference with DOI to the package Description, as well as to the References section of WoodburyMatrix.Rd
* Updated URL and BugReports links to https://, as they now trigger a NOTE on devel due to a redirect

## Test environments

* Local OS X install, R 4.0.2
* Ubuntu 16.04.6 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 2 notes

* This is a new submission.
* Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
     Harville (10:459)
     Woodbury (2:39, 10:241)
  These are names.
